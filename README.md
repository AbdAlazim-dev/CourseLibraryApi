# CourseLibraryApi
<p>
 The Course Library API is a project aimed at practicing the creation of an API with ASP.NET Core 6. I will be following the "ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Deep Dive" course by Kevin Dockx.
</p>
<h3>This repository serves as a proof that I have successfully implemented an API with the following capabilities:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Manipulating resourses with MVC architectural pattern</li> 
 <li>Validating Data and Reporting Validation Errors</li> 
 <li>Support filetering, searching and data shapping with object extentions</li> 
 <li>Support paging and providing pagination meta-data</li> 
 <li>Support sorting</li> 
 <li>Provide HATEOAS Links with the resourses response</li> 
 <li>Create custom action constrain to improve the reliability with advanced content negotiation</li> 
 <li>provide each response with caching headers</li> 
</ul>
